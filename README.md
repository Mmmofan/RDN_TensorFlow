# Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution
TensorFlow implementatoin of Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution, paper click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08797)

References: [Author's version](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RDN), [PyTorch version](https://github.com/lingtengqiu/RDN-pytorch), [Another tensorflow](https://github.com/hengchuan/RDN-TensorFlow/blob/master/README.md)

I have to admmit, I didn't get the result as good as the author said in paper(about 1dB PSNR low), hope someone can get that.

## Requirements
